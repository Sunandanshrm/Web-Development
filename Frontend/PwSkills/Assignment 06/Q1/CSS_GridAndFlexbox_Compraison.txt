CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools in CSS, each with distinct strengths.
CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, providing robust control over 
both rows and columns.
This makes it ideal for complex, large-scale layouts like entire web pages with headers, sidebars, and footers.
It allows for precise placement of items within a defined grid, enabling complex designs that require detailed alignment and spacing control.

In contrast, Flexbox is tailored for one-dimensional layouts, focusing on either rows or columns.
It excels in distributing space and aligning items within a single axis, making it perfect for simpler, flexible layouts such as navigation bars, toolbars, or single rows of items.
Flexbox is more straightforward and adaptive, suitable for responsive designs where items need to adjust based on the container's direction and alignment properties.

The choice between CSS Grid and Flexbox depends on the complexity of the layout and whether control over one or both dimensions is required.
